# Project Overview
To predict short-term (next few hours/days) or long-term (weeks/months) electricity demand using machine learning and time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet and XGBoost.

## 1. Dataset Overview
### Source: 
Kaggle - Smart Meter Electricity Consumption</br>
### Description: 
It contains hourly energy consumption, temperature, and timestamps.</br>
### Column Summary:
- datetime: Time of the reading (hourly or more frequent).</br>
- consumption: Energy used in kWh for that period.</br>
- temperature: Ambient temperature during the reading.</br>
- humidity, wind_speed: Extra weather variables that affect energy usage.</br>
- mean_consumption_last_24h / std_consumption_last_7d: Rolling consumption statistics indicating recent usage trends.</br>
- is_anomaly: Boolean flag for anomalous readings (spikes or drops).

### Business Value of Each Column:
- datetime: Enables precise forecasting for planning and operations.</br>
- consumption: The key metric for understanding how much energy will be needed and when.</br>
- Weather features: Provide context like Demand spikes during heatwaves or cold spells, guiding purchase and grid planning.</br>
- Historical stats: Capture short-term trends and help auto-adjust forecasts based on recent usage behavior.</br>
- Anomaly labels: Ensure forecasts are robust, ignoring spurious data to prevent bad buying or load-balancing decisions.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
### Steps Taken:
- Parse timestamps to ensure a datetime format and set as index.</br>
- Resample data to a consistent hourly frequency.</br>
- Handle missing values using interpolation or forward-filling.</br>
- Outlier detection (optional): We can use Z-score or IQR method to detect and smooth spikes.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Goals:
- Understand the structure of the data.</br>
- Identify seasonality, trends, peaks, and valleys.</br>
- Find relationships between weather and energy demand.</br>

### Plots:
- Hourly/weekly average demand.</br>
- Consumption vs. temperature scatter plot.</br>
- ACF/PACF plots to detect autocorrelations.</br>

### Insights:
- Clear daily seasonality (higher usage in the evenings).</br>
- Weekend vs Weekday patterns.</br>
- Strong correlation between temperature and demand.</br>

## 4. Feature Engineering
### Created Features:

| Feature                      | Description                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `hour`, `dayofweek`, `month` | Time-based cyclic patterns                  |
| `is_holiday`                 | Boolean for public holidays                 |
| `temperature`, `humidity`    | Exogenous variables                         |
| `lag_1`, `lag_24`, `lag_168` | Previous values to capture autocorrelation  |
| `rolling_mean_24`            | Smoothed consumption over the last 24 hours |


## 5. Modeling Techniques
### A. SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA + Exogenous Variables)
- Captures linear trends + seasonality.</br>
- Supports exogenous inputs like temperature and holiday effects.</br>

- Pros: Interpretable.</br>
- Cons: Struggles with non-linear or sudden changes.

### B. Prophet (by Facebook)
- Automated trend + seasonal decomposition</br>
- Built-in holiday effects and changepoint detection.</br>

- Pros: Handles seasonality well, easy to use.</br>
- Cons: Less customizable for complex lags.

### C. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory - Neural Network)
- Captures long-term dependencies and complex temporal patterns.</br>
- Requires sequential input structure.</br>

- Pros: Great for complex, non-linear time series.</br>
- Cons: Requires more data and compute power.

### D. XGBoost (Tree-Based Regressor)
- Uses engineered time features and lags.</br>
- Very fast and powerful ensemble method.</br>

- Pros: Handles categorical + numerical data well.</br>
- Cons: Not inherently time-series aware.

## 6. Model Evaluation
### Metrics Used:
| Metric                             | Description                |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)      | Average magnitude of error |
| **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) | Penalizes large errors     |
| **MAPE** (Mean Absolute % Error)   | Relative % error           |

### Validation Strategy:
- Train/Test split: Last 7 days as holdout. </br>
- Time-series CV (optional): Expanding window.</br>

### Visualization:
- Plot actual vs predicted.</br>
- Residual analysis.</br>
- Feature importance (for XGBoost).

## 7. Forecasting & Visualization
### Each model was used to forecast future demand for 1 week (168 hours). Visualizations included:
- Line plots of predictions.</br>
- Confidence intervals (Prophet).</br>
- Forecast vs actual (overlayed plots).</br>
- Shap plots (XGBoost interpretability).

## 8. Business Impact
| Area                   | Value                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Load Balancing**     | Forecasts help dispatch generators optimally to meet demand. |
| **Grid Reliability**   | Early prediction reduces blackouts or brownouts.             |
| **Energy Procurement** | Predict demand spikes to lock-in lower prices.               |
| **Cost Savings**       | Reduced reliance on expensive peak-hour energy.              |
| **Customer Insights**  | Identify high-usage patterns or anomalies.                   |


## 9. Final Summary
- Energy Demand Forecasting project gives a company strategic advantage in managing supply, lowering costs, avoiding risk, and meeting customer expectations.</br>
- It solves the challenges of the company such as : </br>
  - Buying too much energy means wasted money.</br>
  - Buying too little risks blackouts or penalties.</br>
  - Sudden demand surges (heat waves, holidays) can strain the grid.
